# W291 - trailing whitespace
# W292 - no newline at end of file

# W391 - blank line at end of file

# E113 - 4 spaces per indentation level
# E301 - expected 1 blank line, found 0
# E302 - expected 2 blank lines, found 0
# E303 - too many blank lines (3)
# E304 - blank lines found after function decorator
# E305 - expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition
# E306 - expected 1 blank line before a nested definition
# E502 - the backslash is redundant between brackets
# E722 - do not use bare except
# E901 - SyntaxError or IndentationError
